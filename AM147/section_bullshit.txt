im too lazy to say this more than 2 times, which I have already. Today is technically office hours not section. 

The Discussion Section assignment is available all week and you may do it in your own time. There is no attendance quiz for today. 

Feel free to ask me any questions you like about the practice midterm, homework, study guide, or anything else :). 

Hope you all have a good week and let me know if there is anything I can do for you
